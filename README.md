# Evalbot

# About
Evalbot is a discord selfbot that evaluates and executes python code in discord

Evalbot was originally created at 5 am because I was tired of copy and pasting <3 emojis however I soon realised how good and diverse the idea actually was. 
Evalbot can replace a wide variety of online tools with massive ease.

# How
Evalbot has 2 main commands and 2 shorthand representations of those commands
 
 - `!eval` / `!->` - evaluate any python expression using eval(), edits your message to the result of eval, if present
 - `!exec` / `!->>` - run any python code using exec(), edits your message to anything you print(), if present


# Installation

1) Download the main.py file 
2) edit the file and replace the TOKEN = None to your discord token
3) start the python file

# Other
Evalbot includes some helper functions (python) to make it easier and quicker to use the bot
These functions are simply python functions defined in the file and can be edited
